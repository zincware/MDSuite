        TODO: We can set up a means of having the main thread check if the test is
            finished on the deployed process and then kill it. That will ensure that the
            test isn't prematurely closed and passes when it should have failed. For now
            120 seconds is more than enough time for this test but we can think of some
            improvements later.
